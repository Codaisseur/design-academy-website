    subheading: We work hard to make this course affordable to anyone
    description: >
      We work hard to make this course affordable to anyone. The admission fee
      of €800 is the best value for money you will find anywhere in the world.


      We can make you this offer because we work closely with the companies that
      will hire you. Since there are already a lot of graduates that work for
      companies, and they also need designers.


      The company that hires you will pay us back the remainder of your
      education cost - but only if you get hired in a real paid job. You will
      work for these companies directly, and you will choose where you want (and
      don’t want) to work.

      success in any future company or with any project.
